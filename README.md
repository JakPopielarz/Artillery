# Artillery
is an attempt at recreating 2D games such as "Scorched Earth" or (to some extent) the first "Worms".
In such games the primary objective of a player is to eliminate everyone else. To achieve this, various weapons (usually ranged) can be used.
We are confident of our skills, but we have to think realistically. Therefore sadly at first only one kind of missiles will be available, and the cannons will be stationary. We aim to make it interactive as soon as possible, but first few versions will have fixed input.

### Although
this started as an assignment for C++ class, it's worth noting it wasn't compulsory. If it wasn't for our will to learn new things and face challenges, we wouldn't have decided on doing this.

## Principles:
- when starting working on a new feature - create a new Git branch for it
- when finished working on a feature and you're sure everything works as intended - merge it's branch with master
- naming:
    - use DESCRIPTIVE names
    - for "normal" variables use snake_case (all lower case)
    - classes - start with a capital letter
    - each Git branch should be named after feature that is being worked on in this branch
- each and every commit must have a description/message with a brief summary of what has been done (for example "Initializing CLion project and README") <even yours, Kinga>

Anything else? Have fun!
